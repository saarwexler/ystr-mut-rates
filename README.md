Datasets for Y-STR mutation rate paper

File | Description
---- | ---------
1000Y.MLtree.lengths.bootstraps.rooted.rotated.20140826.nwk | Rooted Y-chromosome phylogeny for 1000 Genomes samples
SGDP.MLtree.rooted.nwk | Rooted Y-chromosome phylogeny for Simons Genome Diversity Project (SGDP) samples
hg19_ystr_reference.bed | BED file containing coordinates for Y-STRs relative to the hg19 human reference genome
GRCh38_ystr_reference.bed | BED file containing coordinates for Y-STRs relative to GRCh38 human reference genome
1kg_calls.pass.info.vcf.gz | VCF containing only the **INFO** field for all Y-STRs that passed the call set filters in the 1000 Genomes dataset. Contains information for both fixed and polymorphic loci, but no individual calls
sgdp_calls.pass.info.vcf.gz | VCF containing only the **INFO** field for all Y-STRs that passed the call set filters in the SGDP dataset. Contains information for both fixed and polymorphic loci, but no individual calls
1kg_calls.variable.min_qual.vcf.gz | VCF containing calls for all **polymorphic** Y-STRs that passed the filters in the 1000 Genomes dataset. On a per-locus basis, individual calls not passing the filters have been replaced with a missing genotype
sgdp_calls.variable.min_qual.vcf.gz | VCF containing calls for all **polymorphic** Y-STRs that passed the filters in the SGDP dataset. On a per-locus basis, individual calls not passing the filters have been replaced with a missing genotype
